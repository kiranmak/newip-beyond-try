## About the Workshop

The New IP and Beyond workshop aims to assimilate research challenges in fixed-network protocols complementing 5G, B5G and 6G radio technologies.
In particular the focus is on large-scale special-purpose industry verticals, autonomous operations, reliable supply-chains, metaverse and digital twins - requiring, 
 extremely reliant, intelligent, and lean network to ensure the efficiency of remote operations.

It is a forum to bring forth ideas to prepare networks for unexpected events and demonstrating 
research conducted in interoperability paradigms.
